## 🔐 About Me
I’m a cybersecurity student at Waukesha County Technical College (WCTC) with hands-on experience in:

- SIEM analysis (Splunk, Elastic)
- IDS/IPS (Suricata)
- Firewall configuration & DNS sinkholing (pfSense)
- Vulnerability scanning (Nessus Essentials)
- Log analysis (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, Linux logs)
- Scripting (Python, Bash, PowerShell)
- Threat hunting methodologies (MITRE ATT&CK, Cyber Kill Chain)
- Virtual lab environments (NetLab+, Parallels, Security Onion)
- Incident response fundamentals (NIST, CISA)

I’m actively building a professional cybersecurity portfolio and am pursuing opportunities in:

✔ Security Operations  
✔ Threat Hunting  
✔ SOC Analyst Roles  
✔ Security Engineering  
✔ Cloud Security
